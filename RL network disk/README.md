> You can only register. After registration, please manage it in "RLGG Toolbox" "Network Disk Tool"

If the website cannot be opened, you can jump to the toolbox, common toolbox



If all the above domain names are inaccessible, please open RLGG and run the RLGG toolbox, open the common tools, and find the RL network disk registration.

------

If you are still worried about not knowing which GG to choose to deploy the project

When you see this document, I will share your troubles with you.

How much does it cost to create a project? 5 yuan? 10 yuan? 30 yuan?

I don't know, but!

**RLGG only needs 1 yuan**



**Is it so cheap and reliable? **

- The server will not store your source files
  - When updating in RL Cloud, the updated data is first specially encoded, encrypted and compressed locally (thanks to the power of RLGG) before uploading, and the server will never leak your source files
- How secure is the encryption?
  - The 1 yuan package uses RLGG free version encryption, but its security value is greater than most ordinary GG encryption

- What are the reverse costs?
  - For a 1 yuan project, the other party needs to spend 500 times the cost to decrypt (500 yuan +)
- Why and how cheap
  - The 1 yuan package is called the "Support Edition", and my goal is to support those friends who are just starting out, so that they can maintain their projects efficiently at a super low cost and escort their growth
  - If your project is profitable, it is recommended to purchase a more advanced package to support the author. You will get more distinguished service support, and RLGG will do better and better



# use

#### Video Tutorial

[RL network disk basic use video tutorial.zip](https://lanzoux.com/igrKE0t7sssb)



#### Basic usage

If you don't have an RL Cloud Disk account, please go to the official website to [register](http://pan.rlyun.asia/signup) an account

Open https://gitee.com/rlyun/rlgg to download RLGG and RLGG toolbox

After installing and opening RLGG, run the RLGG toolbox (generated by the RL cloud container) and find the network disk tool to open it.

Add your account to log in to the network disk tool, select Activate Network Disk, and enter the activation code you purchased to activate it.

After activation, open RL Cloud Update. For the first time use, select "New Project" "Open Project" "Upload Update" "Built-in Code"

The built-in code obtained can be used to be built into RLGG. The built-in code will generate a local file that can be used to run the RL cloud update project

The specific usage of the built-in is introduced in this document



#### Encryption Usage

##### Free version encryption

If you only have the free version of encryption, you do not need to encrypt separately before using Cloud Update, because Cloud Update will automatically encrypt the file using the free version of encryption before uploading it.



##### Paid version encryption

If your package includes encryption, then before the cloud update, you should go to **RLGG Toolbox**, select **Encryption Tool**, encrypt your files first, and then perform the cloud update

> Cloud updates will only be encrypted once for the free version before uploading to the server, and paid encryption needs to be performed separately

For more detailed tutorials, please see **Advanced Use**

# tool



##RL Cloud Update

**What is RL Cloud Update?**



RL Cloud Update can help you quickly update RLGG projects. Its management is very efficient and uses hot update technology.

You only need to upload the files that need to be updated in the RL Cloud Update Tool to update

After the upload is successful, when your user opens the RL Cloud to update the project, the latest project you uploaded will be run.

You can use RL Cloud to update the built-in RLGG, or to load the configuration



**What is hot update technology?**

Update your project without repackaging your APK

The client does not need to download the cloud project every time, and the running speed is fast



![](http://pan.rlyun.asia/api/v3/file/get/7750/%E7%83%AD%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0%E6%8A%80%E6%9C% AF%E6%98%AF%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88.png?sign=JWJDqypDqpgStG8WkjAZaDL04wZENQXGN1YG70-82_4%3D%3A0)



When running an RL Cloud-updated project, it first accesses a cloud configuration with minimal memory.

> Small memory means short time consumption

This configuration contains the **digital signature** and **file address** of the latest version of the project

- **If** the file address in the cloud configuration does not exist in the local cache; **then** cache the file at the address locally and load it

- **Other** It means there is a local cache file; **Then** Continue to verify whether the signature of the local file is consistent with the signature of the cloud configuration
  - **If** the signatures are inconsistent; it means there is a newer version. **Then** cache the file at the file address in the cloud configuration to the local computer and load it
  - **Other** means no update is needed; **Then** directly load the local cache file; omitting the time to download the cloud file

> Overall it loads very fast



## RL Cloud Container

**What is RL Cloud Container?**



RL Cloud Container can help you collect RL Cloud updated projects together and publish them in a unified manner

When running a project in the RL Cloud container, all projects in the container will be listed for users to choose from.

You don't need to deploy a software for each project. RL Cloud Container helps you save a lot of maintenance costs.

>RL cloud container is essentially RL cloud update technology, and its loading is also hot update



## Cloud file external links

**What is Cloud File Link?**



Cloud file links can help you store local files in the cloud

You can use the obtained external links to

- layout image resources
- Cloud sh, when your script needs to call sh file, this is a good choice
- Cloud lua, you can use it on ordinary GG

Compared with other network disks, what are the advantages of RL network disk?

- RL network disk supports updates. You can update by uploading new files in the **Cloud File Link** tool
